        A channel make the link between a Communication Interface and one or more streams.
        MutiChannels are channels with several streams. That only mean all the streams of one
        channel share the same Communication Interface. They need NOT to be sent together nor
        at the same time/frequency.

          The Communication interface define the sockets to be used to send/receive data.
          A producer shall have one unicast socket per consumer.
          The producer write to DstIP/DstPort.
          The consumer ALSO read from DstIP/DstPort.
          SrcIP/SrcPort are used for optional UDP tricks that are not used in these examples.

        <!--
            All ED247 stream - not only AFDX - have the following properties:
            - Name: Identify the stream within the EC. It has to be unique for one ECIC.
            This name is not used for the transport. Producer and consumers may use different
            names for the same stream. Moreover, two ECs can use the same name for different streams.
            - SampleMaxSizeBytes: Maximum size of one sample, in bytes.
              * The same attribute is used for fixed-size sample like AFDX sampling.
              * Fixed to 4 for A429 buses, the size of one A429 word (attribute cannot be set)
            - SampleMaxNumber: Maximum number of samples that can be sent or received
             in one ED247 stream (in samples count, not bytes).
              * With the library, if you push or receive more than SampleMaxNumber samples,
                older ones are lost. If you only need the last value, like for AFDX sampling, this
                attribute can be set to 1. This is more complex for buses, see next example.
            - Direction

            The UID is a transport information that identify the stream within the channel.
            For revision A, It has to be unique for this channel.
